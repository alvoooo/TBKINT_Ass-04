        <h2>2. What are the functional differences between the front-end of a web application and its back-end?</h2>
        <p>Front end development is programming which focuses on the visual elements of a website or app that a user will interact with (the client side). Meanwhile, back end development focuses on the side of a website users can't see (the server side).<br>
            Front-end development is about making sites and web applications render on the client-side, back-end development is all about making these apps render server-side.</p>

            <h2>3. In your own words, explain the process that takes place from when you type a URL address bar in your browser until you finally view the page you have requested.</h2>
        <p>After you’ve typed the URL into your browser and pressed enter, the browser needs to figure out which server on the Internet to connect to. To do that, it needs to look up the IP address of the server hosting the website using the domain you typed in. It does this using a DNS lookup.<br>
            Because DNS is complex and has to be blazingly fast, DNS data is cached at different layers between your browser and at various places across the Internet.<br>
             Your browser checks its own cache, the operating system cache, a local network cache at your router, and a DNS server cache on your corporate network or at your internet service provider (ISP).<br> 
             If the browser cannot find the IP address at any of those cache layers, the DNS server on your corporate network or at your ISP does a recursive DNS lookup.<br>
             A recursive DNS lookup asks multiple DNS servers around the Internet, which in turn ask more DNS servers for the DNS record until it is found.
            Once the browser gets the DNS record with the IP address, it’s time for it to find the server on the Internet and establish a connection.</p>

            <h2><u>Adding Images</u></h2>
        
             <div class="alert">
                <span class="closebtn" onclick="this.parentelement.stle.display='none';"></span>
                Before adding images to your website you should think about shareability, storage space,image quality, ease of use, privacy options and cost.
